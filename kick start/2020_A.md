1. 题目描述

   ### Problem

   There are **N** houses for sale. The i-th house costs **Ai** dollars to buy. You have a budget of **B** dollars to spend.

   What is the maximum number of houses you can buy?

   ### Input

   The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow. Each test case begins with a single line containing the two integers **N** and **B**. The second line contains **N** integers. The i-th integer is **Ai**, the cost of the i-th house.

   ### Output

   For each test case, output one line containing `Case #x: y`, where `x` is the test case number (starting from 1) and `y` is the maximum number of houses you can buy.

   ### Limits

   Time limit: 15 seconds per test set.
   Memory limit: 1GB.
   1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100.
   1 ≤ **B** ≤ 105.
   1 ≤ **Ai** ≤ 1000, for all i.

   #### Test set 1

   1 ≤ **N** ≤ 100.

   #### Test set 2

   1 ≤ **N** ≤ 105.

   In Sample Case #1, you have a budget of 100 dollars. You can buy the 1st and 3rd houses for 20 + 40 = 60 dollars.

   In Sample Case #2, you have a budget of 50 dollars. You can buy the 1st, 3rd and 4th houses for 30 + 10 + 10 = 50 dollars.

   In Sample Case #3, you have a budget of 300 dollars. You cannot buy any houses (so the answer is 0).

   Help Dr. Patel pick the **P** plates that would maximize the total sum of beauty values.

   ### Input

   The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the three integers **N**, **K** and **P**. Then, **N** lines follow. The i-th line contains **K** integers, describing the beauty values of each stack of plates from top to bottom.

   ### Output

   For each test case, output one line containing `Case #x: y`, where `x` is the test case number (starting from 1) and `y` is the maximum total sum of beauty values that Dr. Patel could pick.

   ### Limits

   Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.
   Memory limit: 1GB.
   1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100.
   1 ≤ **K** ≤ 30.

   In Sample Case #1, Dr. Patel needs to pick **P** = 5 plates:

   - He can pick the top 3 plates from the first stack (10 + 10 + 100 = 120).
   - He can pick the top 2 plates from the second stack (80 + 50 = 130) .

   In total, the sum of beauty values is 250.



   In Sample Case #2, Dr. Patel needs to pick **P** = 3 plates:

   - He can pick the top 2 plates from the first stack (80 + 80 = 160).
   - He can pick no plates from the second stack.
   - He can pick the top plate from the third stack (20).

   In total, the sum of beauty values is 180.

1. 题目描述

   ### Problem

   Tambourine has prepared a fitness program so that she can become more fit! The program is made of **N** sessions. During the i-th session, Tambourine will exercise for **Mi** minutes. The number of minutes she exercises in each session are *strictly increasing*.



   The *difficulty* of her fitness program is equal to the maximum difference in the number of minutes between any two consecutive training sessions.

   To make her program less difficult, Tambourine has decided to add up to **K** additional training sessions to her fitness program. She can add these sessions anywhere in her fitness program, and exercise any positive integer number of minutes in each of them. After the additional training session are added, the number of minutes she exercises in each session must still be strictly increasing. What is the minimum difficulty possible?

   ### Input

   The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the two integers **N** and **K**. The second line contains **N** integers, the i-th of these is **Mi**, the number of minutes she will exercise in the i-th session.

   ### Output

   For each test case, output one line containing `Case #x: y`, where `x` is the test case number (starting from 1) and `y` is the minimum difficulty possible after up to **K** additional training sessions are added.

   ### Limits

   Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.
   Memory limit: 1GB.
   1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100.
   For at most 10 test cases, 2 ≤ **N** ≤ 10^5.
   For all other test cases, 2 ≤ **N** ≤ 300.
   1 ≤ **Mi** ≤ 10^9.
   **Mi** < **Mi+1** for all i.

   #### Test set 1

   **K** = 1.

   #### Test set 2

   1 ≤ **K** ≤ 10^5.

   #### Sample #1

   In Case #1: Tambourine can add up to one session. The added sessions are marked in bold: 100 **150** 200 230. The difficulty is now 50.



   #### Sample #2

   In Case #1: Tambourine can add up to six sessions. The added sessions are marked in bold: 9 10 **12 14 16 18** 20 **23** 26 **29** 30. The difficulty is now 3.

   In Case #2: Tambourine can add up to three sessions. The added sessions are marked in bold: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 **8 9** 10. The difficulty is now 1. Note that Tambourine only added two sessions.

2. 实现

   二分法，不知道怎么看出来的，大概是所有的nlong(n)算法里挨个试？或者从Mi的范围限制看出来的?

   ```c++
   #include<bits/stdc++.h>
   using namespace std;
   using LL = long long;
   constexpr int maxn = 120000;
   LL M[maxn];
   int main(){
       ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
       cin.tie(nullptr);
       cout.tie(nullptr);
       int T;
       cin >> T;
       for(int t = 1; t <= T; t += 1){
           int N, K;
           cin >> N >> K;
           for(int i = 1; i <= N; i += 1) cin >> M[i];
           LL L = 1, R = 1000000000;
           while(L < R){
               LL m = (L + R) >> 1;//想要最大difficult为m，最少需要插入多少个训练
               LL k = 0;
               for(int i = 1; i < N; i += 1)
                   k += (M[i + 1] - M[i] + m - 1) / m - 1;//需要在M[i]和M[i+1]之间插入的训练
               if(k > K) L = m + 1;
               else R = m;
           }
           cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << L << "\n";

1. 题目描述

   ### Problem

   Pip has **N** strings. Each string consists only of letters from `A` to `Z`. Pip would like to bundle their strings into *groups* of size **K**. Each string must belong to exactly one group.

   The *score* of a group is equal to the length of the longest prefix shared by all the strings in that group. For example:

   - The group `{RAINBOW, RANK, RANDOM, RANK}` has a score of 2 (the longest prefix is `'RA'`).
   - The group `{FIRE, FIREBALL, FIREFIGHTER}` has a score of 4 (the longest prefix is `'FIRE'`).
   - The group `{ALLOCATION, PLATE, WORKOUT, BUNDLING}` has a score of 0 (the longest prefix is `''`).



   Please help Pip bundle their strings into groups of size **K**, such that the sum of scores of the groups is maximized.

   ### Input

   The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the two integers **N** and **K**. Then, **N** lines follow, each containing one of Pip's strings.

   ### Output

   For each test case, output one line containing `Case #x: y`, where `x` is the test case number (starting from 1) and `y` is the maximum sum of scores possible.

   ### Limits

   Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.
   Memory limit: 1GB.
   1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100.
   2 ≤ **N** ≤ 105.
   2 ≤ **K** ≤ **N**.
   **K** divides **N**.
   Each of Pip's strings contain at least one character.
   Each string consists only of letters from `A` to `Z`.

   #### Test set 1

   Each of Pip's strings contain at most 5 characters.

   #### Test set 2

   The total number of characters in Pip's strings across all test cases is at most 2 × 106.

   int newnode(){//新建一个树节点
       nn += 1;//id
       fill(kid[nn], kid[nn] + 26, 0);
       cnt[nn] = par[nn] = dep[nn] = 0;
       return nn;
   }
   LL M[maxn];
   int main(){
       ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
       cin.tie(nullptr);
       cout.tie(nullptr);
       int T;
       cin >> T;
       for(int t = 1; t <= T; t += 1){
           nn = 0;
           newnode();
           int N, K;
           cin >> N >> K;
           for(int i = 0; i < N; i += 1){
               string s;
               cin >> s;
               int p = 1;
               for(char c : s){//将s加入前缀树
                   if(not kid[p][c - 'A']){
                       kid[p][c - 'A'] = newnode();
                       par[kid[p][c - 'A']] = p;
                       dep[kid[p][c - 'A']] = dep[p] + 1;
                   }
                   p = kid[p][c - 'A'];
               }
               cnt[p] += 1;
           }
           int ans = 0;
           for(int i = nn; i; i -= 1){//一定是从某个叶子节点开始，逐渐向上遍历
               ans += cnt[i] / K * dep[i];//当前节点所能构成的组数*高度(公共前缀长度)
               cnt[par[i]] += cnt[i] % K;//剩余的不足K个的，将其加入父节点
           }
           cout << "Case #" << t << ": " << ans << "\n";
